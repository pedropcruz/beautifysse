# Frontend Development Rules

## Coding Style
*   **Clean Code**: Follow Robert C. Martin's principles. Small functions, meaningful names.
*   **Functional Programming**: Prefer pure functions, immutability, and composition over Classes/OOP.
*   **Comments**: NO random comments. Code should document itself. Use comments only for "Why", not "What".

## Architecture
*   **Types**: ALL interfaces and types must be defined in the `types/` directory at the root. Do not clutter components with type definitions.
*   **Components**: Keep components focused (Single Responsibility).
