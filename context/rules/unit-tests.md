# Unit Testing Rules

## Framework
*   **Vitest**

## Mandates
1.  **Business Logic Coverage**: ANY business logic (utils, parsers, transformers) MUST have unit tests.
2.  **Location**: Tests should be co-located or in a `tests/unit` directory (follow project structure).
3.  **Style**: Write descriptive test names.
